**1 : What is Database?**

A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).

**2: What is SQL?**
SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.

**3: What is ORM?**
Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique used in creating a "bridge" between object-oriented programs and, in most cases, relational databases.

**4: What is Django ORM?**
ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping. Django allows us to add, delete, modify and query objects, using an API called ORM. Django provides a default admin interface that is required to perform operations like create, read, update and delete on the model directly.

**5:NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non-tabular **databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

**6:What is the deffrence between SQL and nonSQL database?**

The five critical differences between SQL and NoSQL are:

SQL databases are relational, and NoSQL databases are non-relational.
SQL databases use structured query language (SQL) and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.
